Weather API
=============================

The Weather API is a service, which is able to deliver weather forecast data for any given location on earth.
There will be also observation data available.

This repository contains source files for the technical documentation, which describes the Weather API.

A more general description of the service and its usage you find at [https://api.weather.mg](https://api.weather.mg).

This API documentation is written in [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org) format.
Using this format eases automated testing, describing response types or request parameters.
There are many tools available, which may support you in using Weather API's blueprint description.
We're using this API Blueprint sources ourself, for running automated integration tests.
Doing so we can guarantee, that the Weather API service always conform to this documentation.

The Weather API is in "Beta Phase", which means this API or its description may change over time.
